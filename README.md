#  Employee Management System API

This is a backend application built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework** that provides RESTful APIs for managing employee data, departments, attendance, and performance metrics. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and extensible with support for authentication, pagination, filtering, and more.

---

##  Project Overview

This Employee Management System allows organizations to track and manage their workforce efficiently through REST APIs. It is ideal for HR teams and administrators who need tools for:

- Managing department assignments
- Tracking employee attendance
- Recording and analyzing performance reviews

The backend is powered by:

- **Django 4.x**
- **Django REST Framework**
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Token or JWT-based Authentication**
- Optional: Docker support for containerized deployment

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',

        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

---

#### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

#### 6. Create Superuser (for admin access)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create an admin user.

---

#### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will be available at:  
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

Visit: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) to access the Django admin dashboard.
